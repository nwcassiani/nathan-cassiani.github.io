/**
 * DATA TYPES
 * 
 * 0. Data types are how we categorize different types of data in Javascript. They have some unique and 
 * shared properties between them, and allow for the Javascript interpreter to work with different kinds of
 * data.
 * 1. Number refers to numeric data.
 * 2. String refers to a character data type.
 * 3. A Boolean is a true of false value.
 * 4. An array is a zero-indexed list stored inside brackets. It is a type of object, and is therefore a
 * complex data type.
 * 5. An object is a collection of key/value pairs, called properties, stored inside curly braces.
 * 6. A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
 * 7. undefined refers to a value that has no value, or not initialized.
 * 8. The null data type refers to a value that is intentionally nullified by the programmer, and has one
 * value: null. <null> indicates the absence of an object, as opposed to the absence of a value.
 * 9. NaN not-a-number
 * 10. Infinity and -Infinity
 * 11. Difference btw primitive/simple and complex data types
 * 12. Copy by value vs copy by reference
