/**
 * DATA TYPES
 * 
 * 0. Data types are how we categorize different types of data in Javascript. They have some unique and 
 * shared properties between them, and allow for the Javascript interpreter to work with different kinds of
 * data.
 * 1. Number refers to numeric data.
 * 2. String refers to textual or character data. The position of a character in a string is the character's
 * index.
 * 3. A Boolean is a logical data type and has two values: true or false.
 * 4. An array is a zero-indexed list of values stored inside brackets. They can store different data types.
 * It is a type of object, and is therefore a complex data type.
 * 5. An object is a collection of key/value pairs, called properties, stored inside curly braces. The values
 * in an object are stored at specific keys.
 * 6. A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. A function must take 
 * some sort of input and return some output, with some type of relationship between the input and output.
 * 7. undefined refers to a value that has no value, or not initialized.
 * 8. The null data type refers to a value that is intentionally nullified by the programmer, and has one
 * value: null. <null> indicates the absence of an object, as opposed to the absence of a value.
 * 9. NaN refers to not-a-number. It is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the 
 * result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number. It is the only value in Javascript that
 * is not equal to itself.
 * 10. Infinity is a numeric value representing infinity. The value of (positive) Infinity is greater than any
 * other number. -Infinity is the same as the negative value of infinity.
 * 11. Difference btw primitive/simple and complex data types
 * 12. Copy by value vs copy by reference
