/**
 * 
 * FUNCTIONS
 * 
 * 0. Functions allow us to encapsulate a block of code, pass around this block of code in our program, and execute
 * this block of code whenever and however many times we want. Functions should take some input and return an output 
 * where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it 
 * somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
 * 1. There are two phases to using a function: First, the declaration or defintion, which creates the function, and
 * second, the calling or invocation of a function, which executes or uses the function.
 * 2. Functions take inputs, which we call parameters. They can take as many parameters as we want, or they can take
 * no parameters. Arguments are the values which our functions take in when we invoke functions. So, parameters are
 * like placeholders for arguments.
 * 3. The syntax for a named function starts with the keyword function followed by a name for the function, then 
 * parentheses which contain the parameters, then curly braces which contain the code block.
 * 4. To assign a function to a variable, called a function expression, we declare a variable with keyword and name 
 * and assign to it the value of a function defintion. Since the name of the variable is the name of the function,
 * here the name is not include between the keyword function and parameters in parenthesis.
 * 5. How do we specify inputs and outputs? both are optional
 * 6. Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scope. However outer scoped variables cannot do the 
 * same to variables in inner scopes.
 * 7. Closures
