/**
 * LOOPS
 * 0. Loops offer a quick and easy way to repeat an action in our code a certain number of times. The various
 * loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various 
 * situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
 * 1. Explain while, for in, and for loops. A while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified
 * condition is true. For loops loop over a block of code until a specified condtion evaluates to false. For
 * in loops are designed to loop over objects. 
 * 2. Be able to loop any number of times, forward counting up to some liimit, backward counting down to zero.
 * 3. Loop over an array, forwards and backwards
 * 4. Loop over an object.
